### Thoughts for today

Scaffolding out a project the way I did today, while helpful in terms of 'everything-in-its-place' becomes rather diffuclt to edit. I think I may prefer to keep the server file largely intact until later in development when things /demand/ a more modular structure.

Honestly, the biggest issue with this project is the fact that I'm doing it in a "I wonder what if" kind of way. There's going to be pivots. There might not even be a reason to be doing this full-stack.

I'll sleep on it tonight, but I may scrap the backend in favor of a CLI for writing out the ~50 or so models from the paper. We'll see how I feel.

## BACKEND

-   User model
-   Patient model

## FRONTEND

-   Style the navbar
-   Create routes for login / signup
-   Pages
    -   About
        -   As a user I want to know more about the methods and where they come from
    -   Dashboard
        -   As a user I want to avoid seeing models that I find to be inaccurate / ineffective
        -   As a user I want to review the results of previously computed models

DREAMING

-   Make an input component with react that recognizes algebraic input strings.
    -   Use it to allow the user to store their own models.
    -   Fightme Wolfram. :)
