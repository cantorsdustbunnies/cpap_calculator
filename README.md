# CPAP_Calculator

## What's this?

An app for sleep specialists that compares different equations for effective pressure in positive airway pressure devices. All the equations were taken from this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4534631/pdf/SD2015-293868.pdf) (warning: PDF!).

## Why did you make it?

For funsies. My dad is a sleep therapist so he brought me onto the idea with the line "You're good with computers, right? I've got this idea..." ðŸ¤·
